# JavaScript homework

Use jQuery to update the text in the `<div>` element on `index.html` every time you type in the `<textarea>` element.

## Expected behavior
- When you open `index.html` in your browser and enter text in the `<textarea>`, each letter you type should show up in the `<div>`.
- When you press the `Backspace` key to delete a character in the `<textarea>`, the last character in the `<div>` should also be removed.
- When you press `Enter` in the `<textarea>` to insert a line break, the line break should be reflected in the `<div>`.

## How to get started
- Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
- Click on the green `Clone or download` link **on your forked copy** and copy the `Clone with SSH` link. It should look like `git@github.com:your-username/re-coded-js-01.git`
- The next few commands are all run in Terminal (or in the IDE's terminal):
    * Type `cd ~/code/` to change into your `code/` directory
    * Type `git clone git@github.com:your-username/re-coded-js-01.git` to clone the remote repository down to your local machine.
    * Type `cd re-coded-js-01/` to change into the newly-cloned directory.
    * Type `subl .` to open the current directory (`.`, which is the `re-coded-js-01/` directory) in Sublime Text. If you are still using the IDE, either manually navigate to the cloned directory in the File Tree or try typing `atom .` instead of `subl .`
- Code your solution in `js/simple_data_binding.js`, and keep `index.html` open in Chrome. You can simply refresh the page in Chrome to test out the changes you make in `js/simple_data_binding.js`. Remember to keep the Chrome JS console open to watch out for JS errors!

## When you are finished
- Add, commit, and push all of your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.
- Submit a Pull Request against my repository.

# Yalla!
